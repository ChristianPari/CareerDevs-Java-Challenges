# Car Class Inheritance
The purpose of this challenge was to practice work with inheritance.
I was told to create a Car class that would have 3 fields and a method, and then 2 subclasses that will inherit this Car class.
Then each subclass needed a field and method that were unique to them. Also, contain an overriden or overloaded method.
